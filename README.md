## Unsupervised Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to the 'Unsupervised Machine Learning' repository! This repository is your comprehensive guide to unsupervised learning techniques in Python, focusing on key algorithms such as K-means clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).

## Contents

- K-means Clustering: Explore the K-means algorithm for unsupervised clustering, a method used for grouping similar data points into clusters based on their features.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Learn about PCA, a dimensionality reduction technique used to identify patterns and relationships in high-dimensional data by projecting it onto a lower-dimensional subspace.
- t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE): Dive into t-SNE, a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique used for visualizing high-dimensional data in lower-dimensional space while preserving local structure.

Whether you're new to unsupervised learning or seeking to deepen your understanding of these algorithms, this repository provides valuable content, examples, and resources to support your learning journey.
